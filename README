Public Access UNIX Systems (PAUS) are a type of server that provide
various services to a multi-user community.  They first began in the
early 1980's and continue today. Early servers ran various flavors of
UNIX, hence the name Public Access "UNIX" Systems, but later generations
saw a large mix of Unix-variants and, of course, GNU/Linux.  To
recognize the many different operating systems online today, these
systems are increasingly referred to generically as "pubnixes".

One of the enduring characteristics of pubnixes, beyond the simple
access to computational services, is the community that develops among
each system's users.  These communities tend to have a particular flavor
of shared interests, and in many ways it is within these communities
that the vision of a non-corporate Internet remains alive.

The Pubnix History Project is a compilation of writings and resources
about the history of public access UNIX and GNU/Linux systems
(pubnixes).  Its goals are to document the history of these systems and
their communities, and to encourage ongoing participation by new
generations of users and sysadmins.
